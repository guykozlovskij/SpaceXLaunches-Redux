# Marshmallow Frontend Test

## Introduction

Welcome to Marshmallow frontend technical test.
Your task is to create a Typescript app that provides an overview of SpaceX's latest _launches_. ðŸš€ ðŸ›°

## What we'd like you to do

We have fleshed out some user stories that we want to see implemented in the app you are going to build:

- As a user, on page load, I would like to view the list of launches in a grid format sorted from newest to oldest by launch date
- As a user I would like to view a summary of the launch in each grid tile, with key information of your choosing
- As a user I would like to filter the grid of launches based on nationality
- As a user, when I click on a launch tile on the grid, it will take me to a page that displays more information on the launch

You can spend how much time you want to complete the test, we recommend not less than 4/5 hours.
All we ask to you is to let us know, truthfully, how much time you spent on it, this info will help us with context when reviewing the results.

## Setup

Please refer to [SpaceX's open API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/README.md) for this task.

You can also find a scaffold of the application to ease the setting up time of the test.
We have already provided you with:

- A Typescript ready React application with Redux Store
- A dummy counter component connected to a Redux slice as a starting point (you don't have to use it)

To run the app:

```zsh
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

## Requirements

The minimum requirement for this task is the use of the following stack:

- React (with Hooks)
- Redux/RTK (with Hooks)
- Typescript
- Unit Tests
- Styled Components
- Complete both sections in APPROACH.md
