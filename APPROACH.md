# What has been your approach to the test?
I had no previous experience with Redux/RTK, so my initial steps was going through the documentation to understand it better. By looking at the documentation, existing code, and some tutorial videos, I have managed to get a grip of Redux and RTK which to me initially was the most significant barrier.

I could say that I spent a good 5 initial hours just reading documentation and refreshing my memory with React, since it has been a while since I have worked with it. I spent roughly 10 hours of coding and researching all the blocks I have encountered.

# What would you have done if you had more time?
I have encountered a weird issue where my component test would fail with the error message "could not find react-redux context value; please ensure the component is wrapped in a <Provider>", even though in index.tsx, App is indeed wrapped in a Provider. I have spent a good time researching the problem, but could not no luck. I did not think it would be good to spend more time than I have on this already.

Additionally, I would have implemented proper error handling and loading indicators, as well as conditional rendering on the URLs as the data may or may not be present.  

Lastly, one of the TODOs was to implement sorting launches by nationality, however, after looking at SpaceX API docs, I could not find nationality data anywhere, so I hope it is something that was there by mistake.
